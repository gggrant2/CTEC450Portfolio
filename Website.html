      <h1>About Genesis</h1>
      <p>I am anticipated to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Technology with a Concentration in Data Science and Database Administration, from Bowie State University in May 2025. </p>
      <p>I have gained hands-on experience through internships at Bowie State University, the MITRE Corporation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where I contributed to a range of technical projects involving AI security, embedded systems, and data analytics.</p>
      <p>My technical background includes proficiency in Python, SQL, and data-focused libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, along with software like Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, and Excel. I have applied these skills in real-world projects, developing automated systems, analyzing large datasets, and working on solutions for prompt injection vulnerabilities in LLMs. </p>
