# CTEC450Portfolio
Source code for my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site showcases my background, projects, resume, and contact form. Also detailing chatbot implementation and how to navigate the portfolio site.

Hover over and click built-in previewers (pycharm, google chrome, firefox, etc.) to see portfolio. From there, scroll to read through the portfolio. The links under the Highlighted Projects will take you to relevant folders. 
You have the option to either view and/or download my personal resume and an interactive embedded Google Form for users that may want to contact me.

The interactive AI chatbot is embedded from BotPress. It is configured to act as a virtual assistant within the portfolio for users that may want to ask questions pertaining my resume, experience, coursework, etc. To get the chatbot to be knowledgeable about my resume and portfolio, before integrating, I uploaded my resume to the chatbot to act as a knowledge base / where the bot would get information to answer user questions. Then, I defined high level instructions to the context of my resume, coursework and experience. These instructions act as guidelines for the bot to follow so it does not get off topic or provide wrong information. This included establishing an identity for the chatbot (ex."You are a virtual assistant for Genesis Grant, a Computer Technology major with a focus in Data Science and Database Administ..."), defining response style ("Use a clear, helpful, and professional tone. Speak in third person...), etc.

I embedded the chatbot into the html file by copy and pasting scripts from the developer, so the chatbot bubble shows in the web page corner.
